# Contributing to Open API Renderer

Thanks for being interested in contributing to this project! It's Temando's first major open source project so bear with us while we iron out the kinks. The following describes some basic information that should help you get started.

## Browser/device support

This project aims to support evergreen browsers, such as Chrome, Firefox, Safari and IE10+. While the project does not currently implement a responsive design, it will do in the future.

## Linting

This project is written adhering to the [StandardJS](https://standardjs.com/) code style. [ESLint](http://eslint.org/) is used to enforce [`standard`](https://github.com/feross/eslint-config-standard) and [`standard-react`](https://github.com/feross/eslint-config-standard-react) rule sets.

## Testing

This project uses [Jest](https://facebook.github.io/jest/) for testing. Tests should be committed with each code change to ensure regressions do not occur.

> Test coverage is not currently enforced, but it will be in the future.

## Github & Merge Requests

> We prefer small, focused MR's rather than large complex MR's whenever possible.

We use [Github projects](https://github.com/temando/open-api-renderer/projects) to manage phases of development. If you'd like to chip in:

1. Open a proejct and look at the *TODO* column for unassigned work. Generally it's in priority order.
1. Leave a note on the issue saying you'd like to tackle it.
1. Create a new branch in your fork and begin!
1. When raising the MR, include as much detail as possible to help the reviewer

Alternatively, sometimes we have ideas that we are not sure how to approach, or don't fit in with our priorities. These issues are labelled as [wishes](https://github.com/temando/open-api-renderer/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Awish). Feel free to tackle one of these or contribute any feedback.

## Versioning

The project will, in future, abide to [semver](http://semver.org/) and [keep a changelog](http://keepachangelog.com/en/0.3.0/). Right now we are at the peak of development and until we reach a release, these processes would add extra overhead that we are not willing to absorb just yet.
